        Dareyoumate is a place where you may ask your friends questions about
        you. <br />
        <br />
        This also allows you to learn what other people think of you. After
        they've filled out your Friendship Dare, your pals can see their
        responses. Dareyoumate is a fun method to reconnect with old friends
        and family in the greatest way possible, while also strengthening your
        social bonds. While playing this quiz, we want you to smile at least
        once. <br />
        <br />
        Please feel free to share your Friendship DareÂ with anybody so that they
        can see the wonderful responses.
